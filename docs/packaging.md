# Packaging & distribution

**Installing the app?** Start with the [platform setup instructions](../README.md#download).
For sandbox access and bundle updates, go directly to [Linux Flatpak](#linux-flatpak).
The sections below are primarily for release maintainers.

This document covers how `release.yml` builds installers for each platform,
which secrets unlock real code signing / notarization, and how to submit the
package-manager templates under `packaging/` once signed builds exist.

Everything described here runs automatically on every release. Since 2026-08-28 a release is any
push to `main` that touches something shippable — CI resolves the next version from the highest
existing `v*` git tag, writes `<UIVersion>`, commits, tags, builds and publishes in a single run
(see [`development.md`](development.md#uiversion-semver-convention--ci-owns-the-bump)). A manual
`workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run=false` does the same for main's current tip; the default
`dry_run=true` only prints what *would* be released. There are no manual signing steps — the
workflow signs when it can and clearly labels artifacts as unsigned when it can't.

## Artifact matrix

| Platform | Artifact(s) | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Windows x64 | `PKHeX-Avalonia-win-x64.zip` (unchanged) + `PKHeX-Avalonia-Setup.exe` (or `PKHeX-Avalonia-Setup-unsigned.exe`) | Installer built with Inno Setup via chocolatey |
| Linux x64 | `PKHeX-Avalonia-linux-x64.zip` + `PKHeX-Avalonia-<version>-x86_64.AppImage` + `.AppImage.zsync` + `PKHeX-Avalonia-linux-x86_64.flatpak` | Flatpak uses the Freedesktop 25.08 runtime; AppImageUpdate and AppStream metadata are included |
| macOS arm64 / x64 | `PKHeX-Avalonia-osx-{arm64,x64}.zip` (unchanged, ad-hoc signed as before) + `PKHeX-Avalonia-osx-{arm64,x64}.dmg` or `-unsigned.dmg` | `.dmg` contains the `.app` bundle plus an `Applications` symlink |

The ZIP naming stays stable. AppImages use the catalog's application/version/architecture
convention; older releases retain their original `PKHeX-Avalonia-linux-x64.AppImage` name.

## macOS: signing & notarization

`release.yml`'s `build` job (macOS legs of the matrix) gates real Developer
ID signing on three secrets:

| Secret | Contents |
|---|---|
| `MACOS_CERT_P12` | Base64-encoded `.p12` export of a **Developer ID Application** certificate (`base64 -i cert.p12 \| pbcopy`) |
| `MACOS_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password used when exporting the `.p12` |
| `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY` | The identity string codesign should use, e.g. `Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)` |
| `APPLE_NOTARY_KEY_ID` | Key ID of an App Store Connect API key with the Developer role |
| `APPLE_NOTARY_KEY` | Base64-encoded `.p8` private key for that API key |
| `APPLE_NOTARY_ISSUER_ID` | Issuer ID (UUID) for the API key, from App Store Connect > Users and Access > Keys |

If `MACOS_CERT_P12`, `MACOS_SIGN_IDENTITY`, and `APPLE_NOTARY_KEY` are all
present, the workflow:

1. Imports the certificate into a temporary keychain.
2. Re-signs the `.app` with `codesign --options runtime` (hardened runtime,
   required for notarization) using the Developer ID identity.
3. Submits it to `notarytool`, waits for the result, and staples the ticket
   with `stapler staple`.
4. Packs the notarized `.app` into `PKHeX-Avalonia-osx-<arch>.dmg`.

If any of those secrets are absent, the workflow skips straight to step 4
and names the output `PKHeX-Avalonia-osx-<arch>-unsigned.dmg` so it's obvious
from the filename (and should be called out in release notes) that
Gatekeeper will still complain.

The existing ad-hoc-signed `.zip` artifacts are untouched by this change.

## macOS: stable self-signed identity (the "tertius" pattern)

Real Developer ID signing needs a paid Apple Developer account. Without one,
`release.yml` falls back to a second tier before giving up and shipping
unsigned: a **stable self-signed identity**.

**Why a stable identity matters.** Gatekeeper's "this app is from an
unidentified developer" prompt, and macOS's re-prompting for TCC permissions
(Accessibility, Full Disk Access, etc.) and keychain access, are keyed off
the app's *codesign designated requirement* — effectively a hash derived
from the signing certificate. An ad-hoc signature (`codesign --sign -`) has
no stable identity: every build gets a new one, so macOS treats every
update as a brand-new, never-before-seen app. That means every single
release re-triggers Gatekeeper's "are you sure?" dialog and drops any TCC
grants the user already approved.

If instead every release is signed with the **same** self-signed
certificate, the designated requirement stays identical release over
release. macOS then recognizes an update as *the same app* upgrading in
place — TCC grants and keychain items persist across `brew upgrade` or a
manual re-download and reinstall, and Gatekeeper only has an opinion about
the app once, not on every update.

This does **not** replace notarization — a self-signed cert isn't trusted by
Apple, so first launch of a freshly downloaded artifact still shows the
Gatekeeper "unidentified developer" prompt once. What it fixes is the
*repeat* prompting on every subsequent update, and it works entirely without
an Apple Developer Program membership.

**Generating the certificate (one-time, by the repo owner):**

```bash
P12_PASSWORD='choose-a-password' Scripts/make-signing-cert.sh ./secrets
base64 -i ./secrets/signing.p12 | pbcopy   # paste into SELFSIGN_CERT_P12_BASE64
```

This produces a 10-year self-signed EC certificate with the `codeSigning`
extended key usage, packaged as `signing.p12`. Keep this file (and the
password) somewhere durable outside the repo — regenerating it produces a
*different* identity, which resets the stability this whole pattern exists
for.

**The three secrets to add** (repo Settings → Secrets and variables →
Actions), used only when the Developer ID secrets above are absent:

| Secret | Contents |
|---|---|
| `SELFSIGN_CERT_P12_BASE64` | Base64 of the `.p12` produced above |
| `SELFSIGN_CERT_PASSWORD` | The `P12_PASSWORD` used to generate it |
| `SELFSIGN_IDENTITY` | The certificate's CN, default `Patrik Lleshaj` (override via `CERT_CN` when running the script) |

When present, `release.yml` imports the cert into a dedicated CI keychain
(`Scripts/import-cert.sh`, same idempotent import-and-unlock-partition-list
flow used for local testing) and re-signs every Mach-O in
`PKHeX.Avalonia.app` with that identity before building the `.dmg`. The
artifact is named `PKHeX-Avalonia-osx-<arch>-selfsigned.dmg` so it's
distinguishable from a Developer ID build and from a fully unsigned one.

**Homebrew users get the whole problem solved for them.** The cask template
(`packaging/homebrew/pkhex-avalonia.rb`) runs a `postflight` block that
strips the quarantine extended attribute Homebrew's downloader adds
(`xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine`), so `brew install --cask pkhex-avalonia`
never shows a Gatekeeper prompt at all, on first install or any later
upgrade.

**Manual `.dmg`/`.zip` downloads** still see the one-time "unidentified
developer" prompt on first launch (self-signed, not notarized). Either
right-click → **Open** once, or clear the quarantine bit yourself:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PKHeX-Avalonia.app
```

After that one time, updating in place (replacing the same `/Applications`
copy) keeps the same designated requirement release to release, so this
manual step should not be needed again as long as the self-signed cert
itself isn't regenerated.

## Windows: installer & code signing

`release.yml`'s Windows leg installs Inno Setup via `choco install
innosetup`, then builds `packaging/windows/installer.iss` into
`PKHeX-Avalonia-Setup.exe` (registers Start Menu / desktop shortcuts and an
Add/Remove Programs entry that uninstalls cleanly).

Code signing (via `signtool.exe`, part of the Windows SDK already present on
`windows-latest`) is gated on:

| Secret | Contents |
|---|---|
| `WINDOWS_CERT_P12` | Base64-encoded `.pfx`/`.p12` of an OV (or EV) code-signing certificate |
| `WINDOWS_CERT_PASSWORD` | Password for that `.pfx` |

If both secrets are present, the workflow signs both the published
`PKHeX.Avalonia.exe` (before packaging) and the final
`PKHeX-Avalonia-Setup.exe` with a SHA-256 signature and a DigiCert RFC 3161
timestamp. If they're absent, the installer is renamed to
`PKHeX-Avalonia-Setup-unsigned.exe` so SmartScreen's "unknown publisher"
warning is expected and self-explanatory from the filename.

**Note:** an OV certificate alone does not eliminate SmartScreen warnings
immediately — Microsoft's reputation system needs download volume to build
trust for a given cert. An EV certificate (or Azure Trusted Signing) avoids
the warning from day one. Either kind of certificate works with the signing
steps above; only the secret contents change.

## Linux distribution

GitHub releases provide portable ZIPs, AppImages built with `appimagetool`, and
Flatpak bundles built from source inside the SDK sandbox. Choose the package
that fits your desktop; [Flatpak installation and maintenance](#linux-flatpak)
are documented below. A Flathub listing still requires an independent human
submission and reviewer acceptance under its current policies.

### AppImage catalog metadata and updates

`.github/scripts/prepare-appdir.sh` stages the published application, desktop entry,
icon and AppStream metadata from `packaging/linux/`. Both metadata formats are
validated before packaging. The desktop and AppStream display name is **PKHeX-Avalonia**.

The embedded update string is
`gh-releases-zsync|realgarit|PKHeX-Avalonia|latest|PKHeX-Avalonia-*x86_64.AppImage.zsync`.
`appimagetool` creates the delta-update file, and CI publishes it beside the AppImage.
The release fails if that file or the embedded update information is missing.
This enables external AppImageUpdate tools; the application does not automatically
download updates because this metadata exists.

The AppStream default screenshot uses the README dark-theme capture with the
checked-in legal Pokémon Legends: Z-A save; the light capture is also supplied.
See [screenshot provenance](screenshots/README.md). Image URLs are pinned to the
release's source commit, so future README changes cannot alter an older package's
screenshots. No save file is added to the distributed application.
The catalog [supports supplied AppStream screenshots](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io#checklist-for-submitting-your-own-appimage);
its entry needs to be re-tested against the new release to refresh cached metadata.

To refresh an existing listing, comment `/retest` on its catalog PR. If the PR
is already merged, the catalog bot opens a new refresh PR. After it passes and
merges, a second test run writes the generated entry in `apps/` and metadata in
`database/`. The PR report still includes a screenshot captured at application
startup; the catalog page instead uses the supplied AppStream default image.

Updating the generated entry does **not** publish the website. As verified on
2026-09-30, the catalog uses GitHub Actions for Pages, and its
[`Build website` workflow](https://github.com/AppImage/appimage.github.io/blob/master/.github/workflows/build-website.yml)
is manual-only. A catalog maintainer must run it before the public page changes.
Check the generated entry's `screenshots` URL and then the live page's image;
a passed re-test or merged refresh PR alone does not prove the screenshot is live.

The .NET runtime is bundled, but Linux system libraries are still required. The
catalog's initial report identified a glibc 2.27 reference; this is not a guarantee
that every distribution with that glibc version supports the bundled .NET runtime.
Use a [supported .NET 10 Linux distribution](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/install/linux)
with the runtime's native dependencies. On systems without FUSE, launch with
`--appimage-extract-and-run`.

## Package managers (Homebrew cask, winget)

Publishing to Homebrew/winget means opening a PR against **their**
repositories (`homebrew/homebrew-cask`, `microsoft/winget-pkgs`) — this repo
cannot and does not auto-publish there. `packaging/` contains ready-to-fill
templates plus the exact submission steps:

### Homebrew cask — `packaging/homebrew/pkhex-avalonia.rb`

Prerequisite: a release with signed & notarized `.dmg` files (see above) —
Homebrew cask maintainers reject casks whose binaries fail Gatekeeper.

1. `shasum -a 256 PKHeX-Avalonia-osx-arm64.dmg PKHeX-Avalonia-osx-x64.dmg`
   and fill in `version` + both `sha256` values in the template.
2. `brew bump-cask-pr --cask pkhex-avalonia --version <version>` (once the
   cask already exists upstream), or for the first submission, fork
   `homebrew/homebrew-cask`, copy the file to
   `Casks/p/pkhex-avalonia.rb`, and open a PR.
3. `brew audit --cask --online pkhex-avalonia` locally before submitting.

### winget — `packaging/winget/realgarit.PKHeXAvalonia.*.yaml`

Prerequisite: a release with a signed `PKHeX-Avalonia-Setup.exe` — winget
also flags unsigned installers during validation and Microsoft's manual
review is far more likely to reject them.

1. Replace `{{VERSION}}` in all three files and `{{INSTALLER_SHA256}}` in
   the installer manifest (`Get-FileHash PKHeX-Avalonia-Setup.exe -Algorithm
   SHA256` on Windows, or `sha256sum` elsewhere).
2. Easiest path: `wingetcreate update realgarit.PKHeXAvalonia -u
   https://github.com/realgarit/PKHeX-Avalonia/releases/download/v<version>/PKHeX-Avalonia-Setup.exe
   -v <version> -s` (the `-s` submits a PR directly if you're
   authenticated with `gh`).
3. Manual path: `winget validate --manifest packaging/winget/` then copy the
   three files into a fork of `microsoft/winget-pkgs` under
   `manifests/r/realgarit/PKHeXAvalonia/<version>/` and open a PR.

## Summary: what's automatic vs. gated vs. manual

- **Fully automatic, every release:** zip artifacts (all platforms),
  AppImage, Flatpak bundle, `.dmg` (signed, self-signed, or unsigned), Windows installer
  (signed or unsigned), GitHub Release creation and asset upload.
- **Gated on secrets (automatic once configured):** Developer ID codesigning
  + notarization/stapling for macOS (tier 1), stable self-signed identity
  for macOS (tier 2, the "tertius" pattern — no Apple Developer account
  needed), code signing for the Windows installer and exe.
- **Manual, one-time-per-version, by design (cannot be automated without
  publishing into third-party repos on the maintainer's behalf):**
  submitting the Homebrew cask and winget manifest PRs. Flathub listing requires
  an independently human-authored manifest and a human-owned submission; see below.

## Linux Flatpak

GitHub releases include an x86_64 Flatpak bundle built from the exact tagged source,
using the Freedesktop 25.08 runtime and .NET 10 SDK extension. The bundle does not
require a system-wide .NET installation. Install it on a Linux desktop with Flatpak
and an XDG desktop portal backend:

```bash
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user ./PKHeX-Avalonia-linux-x86_64.flatpak
flatpak run io.github.realgarit.PKHeX-Avalonia
```

The Flathub remote supplies the runtime dependencies; PKHeX-Avalonia itself is not
listed on Flathub. A standalone GitHub bundle has no application update remote:
install the newer release bundle with the same `flatpak install --user` command
to update it. The app keeps release notes available, explains that Flatpak owns
updates, and hides the portable download/install actions. It never replaces `/app`
or starts an update helper inside the sandbox.

File and folder pickers use Avalonia's XDG portal backend. No home, host, or
removable-drive filesystem permission is granted: select individual saves or a
folder through the picker. Persistent portal grants allow reopening selected files;
dragging a host file into the app may require opening it through the picker first.
Use File > Save As to choose a new destination. Settings, backups and other private
data live under `~/.var/app/io.github.realgarit.PKHeX-Avalonia/`. The current Avalonia
11 backend uses X11, including XWayland on Wayland desktops. Network access supports
legality resources, mystery gifts, and release notes; DRI access supports rendering.

### Rebuild and maintain

The [Flatpak workflow](../.github/workflows/flatpak.yml) compiles the committed
source inside the SDK sandbox without build-time network access, exports a bundle,
installs that bundle and launches the native application under Xvfb. It records
the sandbox permissions, runtime log and screenshot as CI artifacts.

On Linux, install `flatpak-builder`, `appstream`, `desktop-file-utils`, Python 3,
and the three runtimes, then build a committed revision:

```bash
flatpak install --user flathub org.freedesktop.Platform//25.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk//25.08 org.freedesktop.Sdk.Extension.dotnet10//25.08
python3 .github/scripts/prepare-flatpak.py tmp/flatpak
flatpak-builder --user --force-clean --repo=tmp/flatpak/repo tmp/flatpak/build tmp/flatpak/io.github.realgarit.PKHeX-Avalonia.json
flatpak build-bundle --runtime-repo=https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo tmp/flatpak/repo tmp/flatpak/PKHeX-Avalonia-linux-x86_64.flatpak io.github.realgarit.PKHeX-Avalonia
```

The preparation script reads version, date, packaging and source files from the
same Git commit and pins the local source archive by SHA-256. It refuses to overlay
an existing destination. Uncommitted edits do not enter the build. Dependencies
come from the checked-in `packaging/flatpak/nuget-sources.json`; each package has a
public NuGet URL and a SHA-512 digest. After changing package versions, run
`python3 .github/scripts/update-flatpak-nuget.py` with the .NET 10 SDK installed,
review the package changes, and commit the refreshed list. Dependency generation
uses the network; the actual Flatpak build does not. NuGet vulnerability auditing
is disabled only for the offline publish; normal application CI retains it.

### Official Flathub route

The requested visibility on Flathub is a separate publication step. Its current
[requirements](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/requirements#generative-ai-policy)
prohibit AI-generated or AI-assisted manifests and AI agents opening or automating
submission PRs, commit messages, descriptions or review interactions. This
repository's Flatpak packaging was AI-assisted and must not be submitted as an
eligible Flathub manifest. The application's AI assistance is disclosed in this
repository; Flathub also requires disclosure of its affected parts and extent.

A human maintainer must independently author and maintain the Flathub manifest,
check the current requirements, use a stable source release, perform the required
offline build, runtime and linter checks, and personally follow the
[submission process](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/submission)
against `flathub/flathub`'s `new-pr` branch. Reviewers decide acceptance; neither a
local bundle nor a submitted PR establishes a listing. The GitHub-based ID
`io.github.realgarit.PKHeX-Avalonia` matches this repository and permits later
[owner verification](https://docs.flathub.org/docs/for-app-authors/verification)
after acceptance and collaborator access.

The application is GPL-3.0-only with GPL-compatible vendored AutoMod code and
separately attributed assets. Existing third-party sprite/artwork provenance and
the original 64px app icon are retained in the package; this work does not certify
third-party artwork redistribution or trademark approval. Flathub requires a
distinct compliant name/icon and prefers a scalable icon or at least a 256px PNG.
Those publication requirements need the maintainer's independent review before
submission; the installed repository bundle is not described as Flathub-ready.
