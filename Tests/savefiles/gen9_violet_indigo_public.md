The fixture is the unchanged `Violet Save/ff/main` member (4,435,308 bytes).

The author explicitly states that the save has edited Pokémon and items. It is storage/workflow test data, not legality or untouched in-game provenance evidence. No schema repair or normalization is applied. Core detection, revision and ordinary save/reopen results must be verified by the tests before counting this as DLC coverage.`nFixture SHA-256: `33A831FA5B8B729895E47BF74D48D5A391BB06467DBC7B49C5BCD82B9F293EAE`.`nCore verification: revision 2, active Kitakami/DLC mode 1, MaxSpeciesID 1025.
